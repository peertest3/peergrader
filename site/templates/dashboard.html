  <h1>Test Assignment {{fork}}</h1>
  <div>
      <h2>Assignment Instructions</h2>
      <p>Your personal <a href="https://github.com/{{fork}}">fork on GitHub</a> is ready with the test
         assignment Python code. To begin working on the assignment,
         <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">install Git</a>
         if you have not already done so, and run the following command to clone your fork locally:
      </p>
      <p><pre>git clone https://github.com/{{fork}}.git</pre></p>
      <p>Once you have the project cloned locally, you can add your code to the assignment file at
         peergrader/sample/hw1.py. The assignment code requires some external Python libraries to run,
         which you can install with the following command using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>:
      </p>
      <p><pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre></p>
      <p>The assignment itself involves implementing some simple image processing algorithms in Python using
         numpy. An example solution of a correct assignment submission is in peergrader/sample/hw1_solution.py.
         To see the output of your implemtation, run the hw1.py directly with
      </p>
      <p><pre>python hw1.py</pre></p>
      <p>Images showing the result of each function will be displayed on your screen.
         To run the assignment submission tests locally, use
      </p>
      <pre>nosetests</pre>
      <p>To submit your code to PeerGrader, push a commit using Git, such as with the following commands:
      </p>
         <p><pre>git add hw1.py
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push origin master</pre></p>
      </p>
      <p>You can submit your code multiple times and the results of each will be shown on the PeerGrader site.
      When you are ready to finish the assignment, you can mark the current commit as your official
      submission.
      </p>
